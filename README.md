# 🌊 Local Data Lake Project

## 📚 Overview

This project demonstrates how to set up a local data lake system for extracting, transforming, and loading data, and querying it using a SQL engine. It showcases the integration of various technologies to create a flexible and powerful data processing environment.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🐳 Docker: For containerization and easy setup of services
- 🧙‍♂️ Mage: Data pipeline orchestrator
- ✨ Apache Spark: For data processing and transformations
- 🪣 MinIO: S3-compatible object store serving as our data lake
- 🧊 Apache Iceberg: Advanced table format for data lakes
- 🌟 StarRocks: High-performance analytical database for querying data

## 📋 Prerequisites

- 🐳 Docker and Docker Compose
- 🧠 Basic understanding of data engineering concepts
- 🐍 Familiarity with Python and SQL

## 🚀 Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file with MinIO credentials:
   ```
   MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=choose_a_key
   MINIO_SECRET_KEY=choose_a_secret
   ```
3. Build the Docker image:
   ```
   make build
   ```
4. Start the services:
   ```
   make up
   ```
5. Access the Mage UI:
   ```
   make browse
   ```

## 📁 Project Structure

- `📄 Dockerfile`: Configures the Mage environment with Spark
- `🐳 docker-compose.yaml`: Defines services (Mage, StarRocks, MinIO)
- `🛠️ Makefile`: Simplifies common commands
- `📋 requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `📁 mage_demo/`: Main project directory
  - `⚙️ spark-config/`: JAR files for Spark configuration
  - `🔧 utils/`: Utility scripts (e.g., Spark session factory)
  - `📊 data/`: Directory for storing sample data

## 🔧 Usage

1. Place your CSV data files in the `mage_demo/data/` directory
2. Run the Mage pipeline to process and store data in MinIO using Apache Iceberg format
3. Use StarRocks to query the data:
   - Create an external catalog
   - Set the Iceberg catalog
   - Use SQL to query and analyze the data

## 💡 Example Query

```sql
SELECT 
  neighbourhood, 
  count(*) as no_reviews
FROM listings 
WHERE reviews ='5.0'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
```

## 🚀 Extending the Project

- 🔍 Add more complex data transformations in Mage pipelines
- 🔄 Implement Delta Lake alongside Apache Iceberg
- 🔬 Explore advanced features of StarRocks for data analysis
